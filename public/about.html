<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kaisi, but I go by Sluggo online. I am a shameless techie and I love to learn!</p>

<p>I hold a bachelor's degree in English Literature with a specialization in Writing and Rhetoric.
  I lvoe languages, even computer ones. I started making and managing websites for friends 
  and I have a few clients that have been with me since the beginning. 
  Currently, I am looking to take my web development and design to the next level by building a 
  professional portfolio to rival some of the big names that dominate this field.
