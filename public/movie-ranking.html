 <h2>Slychump's Top 3 Personal Faves</h2>
 <hr >
 <h3>"Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" </h3>
 <p>Wes Anderson's ability to tell a story is iconic,<br >
and he has tught me a great deal about plot motivation.<br >
This is also my favorite Bill Murray flick! </p>
 <h3>"The Royal Tenenbaums"</h3>
 <p>His character development in this one is unsurpassed.<br >
Also, is his use of dialogue to do so. </p>
<h3>"The Darjeling Limited"</h3>
<p>Anderson's cinimatography is always beautiful, but this film is stunning.<br > 
Angelica Huston is the Wild Fem my caged heart needs, always.</p>
